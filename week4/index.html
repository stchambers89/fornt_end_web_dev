			<p> Using Classes in JavaScript
				Classes are pretty fun once you get to know how to use them. At first, I was a bit confused about the
				constructor formatting and used the dice example but added a method to test the default constructor.
				<br>
				<code class="code">
				const Dice = function(sides=6) <br>
				{<br>
				    this.sides = sides;<br>
				    this.roll = function() <br>
				    {<br>
				        return Math.floor(this.sides * Math.random() + 1)<br>
				    }<br>
				    this.display = function()<br>
				    {<br>
				        document.getElementById(&quot;demo&quot;).innerHTML = <br>
					 	`this dice has ${this.sides} sides`;<br>
				    }<br>
				}<br>
				</code>
				<br>
				I wanted to test different size dice to make sure the object functions as I thought that it would:
				<code class="code"><br>
					d8 = new Dice(8);<br>
				    d8.display();<br>
				</code>
				<br>

				This resulted in an 8 sided die being created with the instance name of d8. The page displayed fine and
				showed the dice had 8 sides.<br><br>
				
				JavaScript also allows you to add attributes and methods to a class. Each class has a prototype, this is
				essentially you being able to access the object blue print and modify it. This is accessing the prototype
				and adding a critical hit function to each dice.<br><br>
				
				<code class="code">
				Dice.prototype.critical = function()<br>
				{<br>
				    const critroll = this.roll();<br>
				    return (critroll * 2);<br>
				}<br>
				</code><br>
				
				After this is done, any object that is a model or instance of the type Dice will now have access to the
				critical function. To Identify what prototype an object is you can use the following code:<br>
				<code class="code"><br>
					Object.getPrototypeOf(d8);
				</code><br><br>
				
				Prototypes should be used to manipulate objects if every instance of that object needs the attribute or
				method that is added or changed. So, adding the method of critical() is a good example, every dice is
				capable of that method. However, accessing the prototype to add a color is not, each dice could have a
				different color and we would want to update each instance of the dice individually.<br>
				
				Modular JS:<br>
				Simply put a module is a small self-contained file, this file can be loaded with variable contants,
				functions, and or ojbects that are like minded. If you are doing statistics you may have a stats module
				that you can import special functions from without needing a huge clunky library. You can even only
				export functions or parts of the module that you need, it’s not an all or nothing export. More like a
				buffet that you can pick or choose from. You can even nickname the module and use dot notation to
				access it.
