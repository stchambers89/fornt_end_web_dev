          <h4>Introduction</h4> 
          <p> Hello, I am Steven and welcome to my portfolio. Within here you will find a variety 
           of notes and small projects that I have done to test and hone my web development skills 
           with an emphasis on interactive JavaScript.</p>
          <h4>Bio:</h4>
          <p>I was a business major and I found myself dreading my course load. One night I was 
            nerding out and trying to modify a old RPG game called Baldur’s Gate. However, it 
            would not run on my new computer, so I found myself diving into forums on how to 
            get the old game up and running like its glory days. I was reading up on modifying files and 
            how the code was read, until I was told to go to bed by my wife. The next morning, 
            I switched my major to computer engineering and I’ve been coding, studying, and 
            building since then.
