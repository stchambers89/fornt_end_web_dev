const - let - var
This is the first time that I have been exposed to these so I wanted to learn more. 
Turns out var's have a global scope, while const and let have block scope. So to 
midigate the chance of variables changing state it would be better to use const 
if the variable never needs to change, or let if the data needs to be manipulated.
