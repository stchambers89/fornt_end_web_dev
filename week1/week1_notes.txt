Was reading through some of the examples found on the links. Took a little dive to learn more
about the .argument object. After reading it to make sense of a line of code, I found the little 
gem that sated that it is outdated or depreciated and not to use it.

MORE READING:
Started to read JS novice to ninja. The intro was good review, but it was on my break, so I didn't 
get very far. 

Started to add more index and weekly files at work as well. Added these directly to the git 
repository since I have limited access at my work. The pull was sucsessful when I got home.
