			    <p>event handling
					This can be something that the HTML page does or the user does. Simply put the event handler “listens” for a specific event to happen. When it does, it allows you to trigger parts of your code that you specify. One of the most common events that I have seen is the “click” event. When the user clicks, something happens. Another common event is “mouse over”. If you move the mouse over a link it may change color to more readily identify where you are about to click. One event listener that I have used is the “keyup” that is linked to the enter button. So when the user clicks the enter button, upon release a part of my code will fire. The example is below:
					
					input.addEventListener('keyup', function (e) 
					{
						if (e.key === 'Enter') {
							enter();
						  }
					  });
					
					
					bubbling and preventing bubbling: Bubbling goes from the inner element out, hitting each element in turn. until no event listener is assigned to an element. 
					
					Capturing: works the complete opposite. if you click on an outer element it will fire the outermost element, then work inward to where you clicked. 
					
					'use strict';
					this "locks down" the code and requires you to adhere to strict coding practices, more like a lower level language like Java or C++. JavaScript Modules use strict mode automatically. 
					
					Linting Tools
					These tools help you adhere to styling techniques such as spacing, using ++ or --, and indentations.
