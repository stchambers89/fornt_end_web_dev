			    <p><b>Event Handling:</b><br>
					This can be something that the HTML page does or the user does. Simply put the event 
					handler “listens” for a specific event to happen. When it does, it allows you to
					 trigger parts of your code that you specify. One of the most common events that
					  I have seen is the “click” event. When the user clicks, something happens. Another 
					  common event is “mouse over”. If you move the mouse over a link it may change 
					  color to more readily identify where you are about to click. One event listener 
					  that I have used is the “keyup” that is linked to the enter button. So when the user 
					  clicks the enter button, upon release a part of my code will fire. 
					  The example is below:<br><br>
					  <code class="code">
					input.addEventListener('keyup', function (e) //on keyup, run this<br>
					{<br>
						if (e.key === 'Enter') {  //if the event key up was the enter key<br>
							enter(); //run this function<br>
						  }<br>
					  });<br>
					</code><br>
					
					<b>Bubbling and Preventing Bubbling:</b><br> 
					Bubbling goes from the inner element out, hitting each element in turn. until no event
					listener is assigned to an element. <br><br>
					
					<b>Capturing:</b><br> 
					Works the complete opposite. if you click on an outer element it will fire the outermost
					 element, then work inward to where you clicked. <br><br>
					
					<b>'use strict';</b><br>
					This "locks down" the code and requires you to adhere to strict coding practices, more like
					 a lower level language like Java or C++. JavaScript Modules use strict mode automatically. <br><br>
					
					<b>Linting Tools</b><br>
					These tools help you adhere to styling techniques such as spacing, using ++ or --, and indentations. <br><br>

					<b>Using Objects and Classes in the to-do App:</b><br>
					The to do app is a fun little project. At first I was trying to keep track of many elements and
					 variables, but when you are dealing with multiple variables that are really the same thing, like
					  an action that needs to be done, it gets very hard to follow and keep track. So, to simplify this
					   by using a Class. A Class is simply a container that stores similar variables. My Todo class has
						a few different parts. The actual text of what needs to be done, if it is done or not, the
						 icon that shows the user if it is done or not, and if it needs to be deleted. Here is what
						  it looks like:<br><br>
						  <code class="code">
					class Todo <br>
					{<br>
						constructor(item, id)<br>
						{<br>
							this.toDo = item;<br>
							this.id = id;<br>
							this.trash = false;<br>
							this.completed = false;<br>
							this.icon = "far fa-arrow-alt-circle-right";<br>
						}<br>
					
						complete()<br>
						{<br>
							this.completed = true;<br>
							this.icon = "fas fa-check-circle";<br>
						}    <br>
					}<br>
				</code>
				<br>
					My hope is that this will act like a gatekeeper and an organizer to keep track of each item,
					 and it’s status. The next week’s step will be adding even listeners to the icons within
					  the object, allowing the user to interact with the to-do list.
